Project title: "Auto Player Connect4"

Description:
The main motive of this project is to the demonstrate the usage of Reinforcement Learning, a part of Artificial Intelligence to make AN INTELLIGENT and UNDEFEATED module of Connect4 auto player and taking input from real world game board through image processing using YOLO framework.

Github repo link: https://github.com/midchaos/Auto-Player-Connect4

Technologies:

Complete above details and send pull request
srs should be ready by next reporting, and update it under srs_docs in Thu directory under this repo
implemented player class for auto player
Will implement board and coin class

17 Jan 2019 update:
pending from last time - Update above details and send pull request.
Assign proper priorities to user stories and dates to all user stories and update it on this repo
SRS to be completed and updated on github (should be in IEEE format) - update pull request
No update from coding front
Will look into design in next lab and coding update
Keep updating github repo regularly. Do not accumulate huge changes locally.
