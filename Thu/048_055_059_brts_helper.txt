Project title: 
BRTS Helper

Description:
The app lets the user know the location of the nearest BRTS stop and the user can enter the destination station. Now, app would fetch and display all the buses that travel on the route that includes both the source and destination stations. The user can board into any of the shown buses and then has to check in to the app as soon as he/she starts the journey. The app will then keep a track of user's location and keep notifying him/her about the upcoming sations and when his/her destination is about to come so that the user doesn't miss the station.

03 Jan 2019 reporting:
add priorities and dates to all user stories and update it on this repo
srs should be ready by next reporting, and update it under srs_docs in Thu directory under this repo
try implement one or two user stories by next reporting
already integrated with android APIs to get user location and detecting near by stations using location.
will explore if they want to go with APIs and UI separated
Good progress!!
