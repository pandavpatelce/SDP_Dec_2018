Project title:Plagarism Detection System for C language.

Description:This system will take set of source code file as input and will calculate percentage of similarity i.e percentage of plagiagrism present in the source code.
		

Technologies and libraries:
		1)For generating parse-tree we will be using a parse generator tool that is ANTLR.
		  We will be taking reference for this tool from this repository from github.
		  url:-https://github.com/meetmehta1198/antlr4.git
		
		2) For parsing and generating Abstract-Syntax-Tree we will be using some materials available on internet.

By next week you should have parsing of one file. Better if you can have parsing of more that one file and some kind of comparison
SRS document should be updated under srs_doc directory which is under parent of your project file in this repo

SRS to be completed. Pandav to reply to their email.
figured out how to use antlr library in maven
Next step is top remove non-terminal nodes from parsed tree and generate tree of terminal nodes and compare such trees from different programs.
Will work on UI for next few days
