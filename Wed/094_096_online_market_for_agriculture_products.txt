You need to put date against each story in p0 and p1 priority, by that date implementation of that story should be complete
You need to be ready with the SRS by next lab
All these changes should be reflected in this document only. So you can clone this repo, create new branch, push it to remote repo and start new pull request.
By next reporting (16th Jan) you should have one or two stories implemented.
SRS document should be updated under srs_doc directory which is under parent of your project file in this repo
