You need to put date against each story in p0 and p1 priority, by that date implementation of that story should be complete
You need to be ready with the SRS by next lab
All these changes should be reflected in this document only. So you can clone this repo, create new branch, push it to remote repo and start new pull request.
By next reporting (16th Jan) you should have one or two stories implemented.
SRS document should be updated under srs_doc directory which is under parent of your project file in this repo

Both are absent
Need to complete SRS as soon as possible.
Send Pull request with priorities and dates for each story updated. Also include SRS in pull request.
Complete 2-3 user stories by next week.

Need to push code to github. Work in smaller chunks, and do not accumulate huge changes locally. Commit and push to github very frequently.
user login, signup and product page has been coded
By next week will add functionality to differentiate user and agent at the time of signup and after login
Are on time. Should be able to complete next week stories on time. And may be more.....
Nice progress!
